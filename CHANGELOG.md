## NEXTRELEASE

### Breaking changes

Please check these when upgrading, especially if you use your own `config.toml` or key bindings.

- The `[keybinds]` section uses a new syntax `"BINDING" = "TOOL-OR-COMMAND"`, e.g. `"<Control>l" = "line"`. The old syntax `line = "l"` still works but is deprecated and logs a warning. [#555]
- Changed default shortcuts:
  - <kbd>v</kbd> selects the pointer tool, <kbd>p</kbd> selects the new pen tool. [#799]
  - <kbd>b</kbd> selects the brush, which now paints with a soft edge and is slightly transparent. The former brush is the pen tool. [#799]
  - <kbd>h</kbd> selects the freehand highlighter, <kbd>g</kbd> the block highlighter. [#761], [#799]
  - <kbd>Delete</kbd> deletes the selected annotation, <kbd>Shift+Delete</kbd> clears all. [#607]
  - <kbd>w</kbd> focuses the size input field, <kbd>s</kbd> selects the spotlight tool. [#804]
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> while drawing a box shaped tool (crop, rectangle, ellipse, blur, highlight, ...) snaps to the aspect ratios configured in `aspect-ratios` (1:1 is one of them) instead of only drawing squares and circles. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> keeps the current aspect ratio. [#647], [#648], [#643]
- <kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> are no longer used by the tools (e.g. to abort or finish a crop) and always run the configured actions, except in the text tool. Tools finish at the end of a drag; use undo to revert. The dismiss and commit buttons were removed from the toolbar. [#607], [#783]
- In the text tool <kbd>Enter</kbd> inserts a line break, <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> finish the text. <kbd>Esc</kbd> no longer discards the text, use undo instead. [#817]
- Without a crop, the exported image includes annotations outside of the screenshot and has a transparent background there. Crop to the screenshot to get the old behavior. [#662]
- Freehand and block highlighter are separate tools. Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> at the start of a highlight no longer switches between them, and `primary-highlighter` / `--primary-highlighter` are deprecated and ignored. The freehand highlighter is called `highlighter` in the config and `--initial-tool`. [#761], [#799]
- Styles moved to the new `[style]` section and can be set per tool. `corner-roundness`, `default-fill-shapes` and `default-round-caps` were removed from `[general]`, use `corner-radius`, `fill` and `round-caps` in `[style]` instead. The command line option `--corner-roundness` was renamed to `--corner-radius`, the old name is still accepted. [#814]
- The size in the bottom toolbar is no longer a factor but an absolute value in px, pt or percent depending on the tool. `annotation-size-factor` scales the sizes once at startup. [#814]
- Lines, arrows and other stroked shapes have flat (butt) caps instead of round ones, so short lines are drawn correctly and handles sit on the ends of the line. [#799]
- `--disable-notifications` shows notifications as an in-app toast instead of dropping them. [#711]
- `--profile-startup` is deprecated in favour of `--log-level debug`. [#711]

### Added

- Edit annotations with the pointer tool <kbd>v</kbd>: [#607], [#673], [#781], [#787], [#795], [#810]
  - Click to select, <kbd>Alt+Click</kbd> to select between overlapping annotations. Thick strokes can be grabbed anywhere on the stroke.
  - Move, resize by handles, nudge with the cursor keys, delete with <kbd>Delete</kbd>.
  - Change the style of the selected annotation with the toolbar.
  - Change the layer with <kbd>Alt+Scroll</kbd> or <kbd>Alt+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>Alt+PageDown</kbd>.
  - Double-click a text to edit it.
  - Resizing a marker changes its number or extra ring.
  - All of this can be undone and redone.
  - Clicking an annotation with another tool temporarily switches to the pointer tool.
  - New config `auto-select-new` selects newly created annotations.
- Image tool <kbd>o</kbd>: click to insert an image from a file chooser, or drag a box to fit it in. <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> pastes an image from the clipboard and images can be dropped onto the window. [#563]
- Pixelate tools: `fringe-pixelate` <kbd>x</kbd> replaces the area with its surroundings before pixelating it, so the original content cannot be recovered. `pixelate` and `fringe` are available as well. [#469], [#646]
- Spotlight tool <kbd>s</kbd> dims everything but the marked area. [#804]
- Lensblur tool <kbd>Shift+U</kbd> blurs everything but the marked area. [#804]
- Blackout tool <kbd>Shift+X</kbd> blacks out the marked area. [#806]
- Pen tool <kbd>p</kbd>, which draws like the brush did before. [#799]
- Rotate and flip the screenshot in the menu of the crop tool button, or with the keybinds `rotate-image-left`, `rotate-image-right`, `flip-image-horizontal` and `flip-image-vertical`. [#TODO]
- Measure tool <kbd>Shift+I</kbd>, a line with ticks at its ends, labelled with its length in pixels and its angle unless horizontal or vertical. The label runs along the line and grows with the line width. [#TODO]
- Grouped tools: related tools share one toolbar button. Open the menu with a long click or a click on the indicator; it also shows the shortcuts. [#600], [#717], [#799], [#813]
- All toolbar buttons and commands can be bound to any key, including zoom, scale, size, fill and round caps. New defaults are e.g. <kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> fit to window, <kbd>Alt+1</kbd> 100 %, <kbd>Ctrl+plus</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+minus</kbd> zoom, <kbd>f</kbd> toggle fill, <kbd>k</kbd> toggle round caps, <kbd>-</kbd> cycle size. Use `"none"` to unbind a key. [#555], [#606]
- Shortcuts work with all keyboard layouts: they follow the active layout, also match keys typed with <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and fall back to a Latin layout or US QWERTY for non-Latin layouts like Cyrillic or Greek. [#608], [#771], [#772]
- All styles can be configured per tool in `[style.TOOL]`, i.e. color, size, small, medium, large, fill, round caps, corner radius and the new opacity. Tools without own values use the general `[style]`. [#814]
- Text style (effect and background opacity) can be configured via fill, round caps and opacity. [#814]
- Open a screenshot from the clipboard with `--from-clipboard [COMMAND]`, default command `wl-paste -t image`. [#679], [#737]
- System wide config in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/satty/config.toml` (usually `/etc/xdg/satty/config.toml`), read before the user config. [#667]
- The crop selection snaps to the image bounds. [#659]
- Round caps toggle rounded corners for rectangle, blur, pixelate and highlight. [#661]
- Pen, brush and highlighter draw a straight 15° aligned line while <kbd>Shift</kbd> is held. [#728]
- Line, arrow, pen, brush and highlighter draw a horizontal line while <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is held. [#801]
- The bottom toolbar shows the aspect ratio of the image or shape, and length and angle of lines and arrows. [#647], [#781]
- Selection, crop border and center marker are drawn with two colors, so they are visible on dark and light backgrounds, and keep their size when zooming. [#659]
- When zoomed in, the screenshot is drawn without smoothing, so single pixels are visible. [#652], [#750]
- Missing folders are created when saving. [#743]
- Saving as jpg, the extension of the output filename selects the format, e.g. png or jpg; transparent areas become white in jpg. [#TODO]
- Saving without `--output-filename` overwrites the input file, if the input is a file; before, saving to a file was disabled. [#TODO]
- Saving without `--output-filename` and without an input file asks for a file with save as, which is then used for further saves. [#TODO]
- WebP images can be opened even if gdk-pixbuf has no WebP loader. [#563]
- New config `notification-grace-period` to wait for the notification daemon to read the thumbnail before exiting. [#635]
- New `--log-level` option, log output has level and severity, and a dialog is shown for fatal errors. [#711]
- Documentation website at <https://satty-org.github.io/Satty/>. [#668], [#763]

### Changed

- Unknown config fields log a warning instead of preventing Satty from starting. [#698]
- Blur is drawn below all other annotations, crop above them. [#607]
- Blur strength no longer depends on the zoom of the canvas. [#804]
- The size sets the opacity of the block highlighter, the darkness of the spotlight and the strength of blur and lensblur. [#804], [#814]
- Highlight, spotlight, blur, lensblur and marker draw a rectangle with fill or an ellipse without. [#804], [#808]
- Switching tools updates the toolbar to the style of the tool. [#814]

### Fixed

- Satty can be installed with `cargo install` again. [#625]
- Notification thumbnails no longer go missing when Satty exits right after saving. [#635]
- `input-scale` no longer has the inverse effect on the window size. [#690]
- Lines, arrows and the strokes of pen, brush and highlighter are visible right at the click, not only after the mouse moved. [#803]
- The transparency checkerboard is no longer drawn into exported images. [#754]
- `--initial-tool crop` shows the crop dimensions. [#641]
- A simple click no longer creates tiny, invisible annotations. [#660]
- The text effect toggle only reacts to <kbd>Alt</kbd> alone, so e.g. <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U</kbd> for unicode input in fcitx5 works. [#696]
- The center marker appears and disappears right when <kbd>Alt</kbd> is pressed or released. [#734]
- Short unfilled arrows are drawn correctly and do not change direction, and toggling round caps no longer changes the arrow length. [#778]
- Custom colors are no longer duplicated in the color dialog. [#669]
- `--help` no longer refers to the nonexistent option `action_on_copy`. [#693]
- Fonts that are named instances of a variable font are loaded; variable font styles are not supported and a warning is logged. [#618]
